# Contributing to the kaggle-toxic-starter

We are open to your code contributions. You can submit pull request with two kinds of code:
1. bug fixes, which will be merged after code review and (usually) some discussion
2. new steps in the pipeline, for example:
  * pre- and post-processing steps
  * ensembling methods
  * neural networks
  * other algorithms relevant to the [challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

## top contributors
We want this starter to be developed collaboratively. At the later stage of the competition we will happily invite top contributors to our team on Kaggle.

## bugs, questions, feature requests
In case you want to:
1. report bug,
2. ask a question,
3. have an idea for a new feature or pipeline step,

just submit an issue. Don't forget to add appropriate label!
